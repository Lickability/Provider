# Provider

A framework that wraps [Networking](https://github.com/Lickability/Networking) and [Persister](https://github.com/Lickability/Persister) to easily fetch content from networking or persistence, and cache / persist those fetched from the network, preventing the need to make unnecessary network requests for already fetched content.
